0 ADVANCEDSTANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

Advanced stances can be learned after you have become a grand master in 
two normal stances.  These stances are much better than the others.
MANTIS: Requires CRANE and VIPER before it can be learned.  This stance 
combines a very strong defence with lightning fast counter attacks.
DRAGON: Requires BULL and CRAB before it can be learned.  This stance 
uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter from injury.
TIGER: Requires BULL and VIPER before it can be learned.  Probably the 
most aggressive of all the stances, this style utilizes very powerful and
lightning fast attacks.
MONKEY: Requires CRANE and MONGOOSE before it can be learned.  The only 
affect of this stance is to completely nullify the advantages of your 
opponents stance.
SWALLOW: Requires MONGOOSE and CRAB before it can be learned.  This is 
the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile dodges with the 
ability to 'roll' with an attack, helping prevent injury.

See also help on 'stance' and 'stancetable'.
~

-1 ALIAS~
The alias system.

You are allowed to have 30 aliases. The following commands can be used.

alias       - Creates a new alias.
removealias - Removes an old alias you don't want.
showalias   - Shows all aliases that you have made.

examples :

* alias cc c 'dispel magic'

By typing cc <target>, the player now casts dispel magic on that target.
To remove this alias, a player would simply type 'removealias cc'.

Feel free to experiment with aliases.

~

8 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
Syntax: ban     <site>
Syntax: ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.

1 ARENA~
The rules in the arena are simple :

* No use of 'safe powers', meaning no going invis, objectform, shadowplane
  or any other power that leaves you safe from attacks.

To beat another player, you must tie them with the 'tie <players>' command,
and that player will be removed from the arena and given a restore.

Last man (or woman) standing in the arena will be the winner.

The arena opens every 2 hours for normal battles, all the normal
rules apply, and the winner gets a small prize. Some of these battles
will be for base classes alone. (you can type timer to see when the next
arena will be).

Currently we are working on some nifty arena commands, and so far we have
made these commands :

* Arenastats - Shows the stats on the people in the arena.
* Arenajoin  - Let's you join the arena when it opens (happens once in a while).
* Resign     - Give up, you'll leave the arena and get an arena loss.

short period of time.  It also has a chance of breaking your opponents 
nose or jaw.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, KICK or PUNCH successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.

1 BATTLEMAGES MAGE MAGES~

1 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~

Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <wand> <target>

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.
~

0 BREW SCRIBE CARVE ENGRAVE BAKE~

brief4 -> Toggle message on exp modifiers, discipline points and class points.
brief5 -> For the very sensitive persons - gives a summary of the combat.
brief6 -> Blocks all 3rd party battlespam.

~

1 BULLY~
It's not considered nice to harass players that are much weaker than yourself.
It is quite okay to mort and tie someone weaker than yourself if they talked trash,
killed your mobs or killed one of your friends, but it is not okay to constantly
harass players that are weaker than yourself simply because you feel like it.

Should a player act like a real bully, a special bullyflag will be added to that
player. Anyone with a bullyflag will show as a bully on who and have a harder time
dodging and parrying. The bully flag will be removed when that player has learned
to act like a normal person.

(Whether a player is a bully or not is decided at the discression of the immortals,
trying to get the immortals to set the bully flag on someone will result
in the bully flag being set on yourself)

We hope never to actually set the bully flag on anyone, this is afterall a playerkilling
mud, and people should expect to be morted, tied and killed; but should harassment be
taken to the extreme by a player, we will set the flag on the offending player.

~

1 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your magical ability increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.

-1 CRUSADERRANK~
#CThe Ranks among the Crusaders of The One True God#n

#GThe Neonates#n of the One True are the backbone of the army of light, and the most
common of the churchs followers. Trained for combat, they normally found fighting
the crawling chaos that is evil.

#GThe Peacekeepers#n of the One True are the elite warriors, ordained through the
trials of blood and horror that is the life of a true Crusader. These warriors have
seen it all; slaughtered demons by the thousands and faced horrors so old and perveted
that most men would die from the telling of the tale alone.

#GThe Inquisitors#n of the One True, are feared even by the hearthy and pure; these
grimfaces soldiers are the lawmakers and the judges of the One True. The word from
one of these alone can condemn an entire village to be burned to the ground.

#GThe Grand Knights#n forms a group of warriors within a world of warriors; these are the
special forces dispatched only to solve the most delicate of problems. Raised with the 
discpline and skill at arms that is the birthright of any Crusader, these men also show
great skill at subtlety and cunning. Do not underestimate the skills of these men in combat;
they may not start hacking at your with their mighty swords the first time you meet them,  
but you can be sure they'll track you down and slay you without even breathing hard, should
you utter a single word against the One True.

#GThe Crusaders#n are the the ruling council, and form the circle of of devotion to the
One True that is the basis of the church. These men are the are considered the closest
thing you can come to the One True, hearing the word of a Crusader is considered hearing
the words of the One True.

~

-1 CRUSADERS~
#CThe Crusaders of The One True God#n

The Crusaders are a sect of holy knights, paladins and noble warriors, who
fight for justice and the love of their One True God. By some the Crusaders
are looked upon as saviors, and by some as fools who have spend to much time
inside their metal armor, frying their brains. From a historical perspective,
we see the crusaders as an important force in the ongoing battle between
that which is considered good and fair, and that which is Evil. The Crusaders
have been the fuel to spawn many epic battles, and no history book is complete
without at least mentioning the legendary battle between the demonspawned
Nightlords and the Crusaders, where hundreds of Crusaders gave their life
in a succesful attempt to banish the Nightlords back to the planes of Hades.

Whether the Crusaders are right in their belief in The One True God (who is
commonly refered to as The Hand of Justice), or the God is just an excuse to
further the Crusaders own cause (which seemingly is to banish all Evil and
restore peace (whatever that means) in the realms), is not up for discussion;
you won't find a crusader talking about ethics or discussing the finer points
of beliefs and religion, but rather you'll find him on a horseback, swinging
his (or her) sword madly, hacking away at evil incarnated.

The worshippers oppose The Loa and The Crawling Chaos in the circle of balance.

Without the contributions and help of these people, Dystopia would
not be what it is today, a great thanks to them all.

  Thanks to Willaz, Antibody, Rand, Nyria and Jatr for their
  work in creating new areas for Dystopia.

  Thanks to Mandrax for his crash recovery system.

  Thanks to Dingo for the core of the automap system.

  Thanks to all the players that have contributed ideas
  and made our stay here at Dystopia a pleasant one.

~

1 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard. Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment (unless it was claimed).

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying. The amount you lose is half of your 
current amount, so it's a good idea not to hoard exp.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
~

1 DECAPITATE KILL PLAYERKILLING PKILL~
The command 'decapitate' can be used to kill another player that is
mortally wounded. Upon killing the player, you gain half of their
current experience.

Syntax: decap <victim>

To see which players are in your playerkilling range, you can either
type 'who kill' or simply look at the colors around the players on
who (the different colors are explained in HELP WHO).

The system that calculates who you can kill, is briefly discussed
in the help file HELP PARADOXSTATS.

~

1 DEITIES GODS WORSHIP~
#n
Few gods survive the harsh demands of the mortals in the realms of Dystopia,
but at least five religions has been know to be worshipped throughout
the realms. These are known as :

The Crusaders of The One True God       (HELP CRUSADERS)
The Worshippers of The Stars            (HELP STARS)
The Mysterious Loa organization         (HELP LOA)
The Covern of Gahr, The Crawling Chaos  (HELP GAHR)
The Pantheon of the Wild                (HELP WILD)

The five deities form a circle of balance, each opposing two of the others.

Religion status : Religions are open, but not 100% done.

~

1 DEMON DEMONS~
Demons are mortals who have sold their souls for power, but they must take the souls
of others to make their power grow, for they are the foul beasts of hell that will
stop at nothing to rule the world. To steal a soul, you must simply decap another player.

summoned. For instance you could say 'What is a demon', and the
djinn would try to answer the question.

give the directions to a demon. The Genie does not always give
a straight path, they can be rather tricky.

* Use #ymccp#n to get the 25% extra exp, it helps the mud run smother.
    #RYou can use mccp with #yANY#R mudclient out there, please#n
    #Rread the help file on #ymcclient#R if your normal mudclient doesn't#n
    #Rsupport mccp by itself. Mcclient is NOT a client, it simply helps#n
    #Ryour normal client so it can use the mccp protocol.#n
* If you for some reason don't get a certain modifier even though your sure
  that you should get it, please recheck everything, perhaps you shouldn't
  get it afterall.

1 FAE~
The Fae is an ancient races of faeriekin, that roam the planes of Limbo
and Gehenna. They are rarely seen in the mortal realms, but those who are so
lucky (or misfortunate, depending on what happens) to meet one of the Fae, will
have quite a story to tell their grandchildren. Do not let the Fae's diminished
stature fool you, they are indeed a force to reckon with, controlling the raw
energied of the plane, and conjuring powerful magics into existance with
the snap of a finger.

The Fae study the arts of Woodlore and ancient magics, and are devotees
of the disciplines of #GARCANE#n and #GNATURE#n (research and train commands to improve).

The four forces the Fae control are called plasma, energy, will and matter,
to unleash these energies, the Fae needs to channel these forces into existance,
using their own "bodies" as the vessel of creation. It should be noted that the
Fae doesn't have a real mortal form or body, but rather are beings of energy.
The Fae takes a mortal form upon entering our world, but they can reform this
body whenever needed, thus realising their stored energies and reforming lost
limbs.

The truly powerful of the Fae can reform their bodies into pure elemental form,
becoming a true Force of Nature. The only real important powers for a Fae
is #GInfuse#n and #GChannel#n, which let's the Fae summon and discharge the four
forces of the Fae.

Be warned though, Fae is a bit hard to play.

Prompt info : Special 1/2/3/4 are used for energies and
              Special 5 is used for faeshields.

Syntax: cast 'faerie fog'

the same room as you.
~

1 FIGHT STYLE FIGHTSTYLE~
Syntax: fightstyle <number> <style>

This is used for unarmed combat, and it allows the fighter to decide on 
their style of unarmed attack.  Many different types of attack are 
possible, each with different advantages and disadvantages.  Your first 
attack in combat always uses the first number slot.  If you have a second 
attack, this will draw a fighting technique from slots 1 to 4.  If you 
have a third attack, it will draw a fighting technique from slots 5 to 
8.  Any other attacks are randomly drawn from any of slots 1 to 8.  If 
the slot is blank (0) then the attack is a standard unarmed attack.
~

1 FIGHTTIMER FT~
On your standard prompt you will notice a section called 'ft',
this is your fighttimer. When your fighttimer is larger than
zero, then no room is safe, and certain powers will no longer
work. Also, the portal spell can be used against you, even
though you have the nosummon flag on.

You gain a fighttimer each time you do battle with another player,
and it will slowly drop outside combat.

~

1 FLEE RESCUE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 FLY~

This spell enables the target character to fly.
~

1 FOLLOW GROUP~

SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
~

7 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command.

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.

0 FORTITUDE~
Fortitude describes a type of supernatural toughness and vigor which
allows Kindred to resist harm.  Many vampires are very tough and are able
to withstand a lot of injury inflicted by weapons and spells.  However 
with the Fortitude power, they resist damage even further by often keeping
the weapons from harming them at all.

-1 GAHR~
#RThe Covern of Gahr, The Crawling Chaos#n

A long time ago, or so the legends tell (not much is known of Gahr before the Time of
Chaos) Gahr was a powerful god, revered by most of the other gods. Gahr was the god
of War, and dabbled a little in the arts of magic. As the story goes, Gahr got delusions
of Grandeur and called upon forbidden magic to enlargen his domain; something went awry
and the forbidden magic took a terribly toll on Gahr. His sanity. Unable to sustain his
immortal form, he became what is now know as The Crawling Chaos. An evershifting form
of tentacles, teeths and scorched fur. Without his sanity Gahr was unable to sustain
control over his wast domain, causing what is known as the Time of Chaos. The churches
of Gahr turned upon themselfs, and the worshippers died by the thousands in the war.
Today Gahr is mostly worshipped by the cruel and twisted, being the god of madness and
chaos he is also the god of slaughter and destruction, and many vile deeds are commited
in his name. Evil warlocks and other spellcasters often invoke the name of The Crawling
Chaos when powerful and destructive magic is called open, and many a sadist and murderer
is a member of the Covern of Gahr, The Crawling Chaos.

The Worshippers oppose The Crusaders and The Pantheon of the Wild in the circle of balance.

-1 GAHRRANK~
#RThe ranks in the Covern of Gahr, the Crawling Chaos#n

#GThe Slayers of Gahr#n are some of the meanest bastards that walk on two legs; born and breed
for the sole purpose of slaughter and destruction these vile creatures are known for their
savage fury and ability to hunt down any prey.

#GThe Diabolists of Gahr#n form the occult backbone of the Covern; these men and women drive
the followers of Gahr into a worshipping frenzy and are responsibly for channeling the powers
of Gahr into a destructive purpose. The Diabolists make most of the planning and thinking in
the Covern.

#GThe Eyes of Gahr#n are cursed with much the same madness as Gahr himself, these are speciel
worshippers, touched by Gahr, and infused with a part of the God. Driven mad and crazed by this
constant unholy presence inside them, they are feared not only by innocent, but also by many
followers of Gahr. They are known to act irrational, and strike out at anyone for no apperant
reason.

#GThe Voices of Gahr#n are a sorry bunch. Not much of the mortal that worshipped Gahr is left,
at least not of the sane mind that once possesed the body. These rambling, vulcanos of utter
power, unleashes raveging, destrutive forces upon buildings and mortals alike.

#GThe Abominations of Gahr#n are those that have undergone the final transformation and has
become a demonthing, avatars of Gahr himself they are sometimes called; like Gahr they seem
to have no control over their bodies, their limbs are hideously deformed, and their faces
and features are those of a demonic nightmare.

1 GIANTS~
The Giants were the first to walk this world. In the beginning, before the gods
created man, and populated the worlds, the Giants would walk with the gods, they
were scholars and warriors, born and breed in the image of the gods. Then came
the time of man; humankin started walking the same earth the Giants had thought
their own for millinia; the time of the Giantwars started, and for many centuries
the children of the gods fought the onslaught of man. Finally the Giants, who had
always been few in numbers, lost, and retreated to the barren parts of the world.
Living in the wast wilderness, in the mountains and on the barren plains, the
Giants declined, both in numbers and in spirit, they became the race of Giants
we know today. The big and ugly brutes, that hates all of man. Few are those
that meet a giant and lives to tell about it, such is the hatred of the Giants.

-1 LOA~
#0What is the Loa#n

The Loa is not one person or being, it is something quite different, you
might call it a multitude of personalities mixed into one existance,
scholars have spent eons studying the few facts we have on the Loa,
but no real conclusion have come of it. Most of the scholars do agree  
on one thing. The Loa didn't create existance as we know it, but there   
seems to be no evidence of the Loa ever having been created itself, so
most people agree that the Loa have always existed in one form or another.

The Loa is also refered to as the snake god, or the Serpent; some religions
know of the Loa as the corruptor or the destroyer. Most religions agree
that the Loa exists, though they all expres a certain antipathy against
the followers of the Serpent god.

The different personalities of the Loa seems to be ignorant of eachother,
striving for different purposes and sometimes even fighting each other,
for a long time, the Loa was revered as several different deities, only
during the last few hundred years have the truth been know about the Loa.

The worshippers oppose The Stars and The Crusaders in the circle of Balance.

#R* #GThe bones of the Loa#n The ancient rod of communication with the
                      gods, whom we know now to be the Loa. Holding
                      this rod allows the wielder to know everything
                      the Loa does, or at least one of it's personalities.

                       the existance we call the Loa. Though most of

-1 LOAWORSHIP~
#0What do we know about the worshippers of the Loa#n

These shadowcloaked people seems to strive on secrecy and information;
it's commenly said about secrets, that if the children of the Loa doesn't
know it, no one ever will. Because the priest of the Loa keep every little
piece of knowledge they got from everyone else, it's almost impossible
to get any information about that church of the Loa, it's even said that
most of the priests don't know the full truth about the agenda of the Loa.

1 MAP AUTOMAP~
By enabling long descriptions for rooms (brief1 must be off),
and enabling the automap feature (type 'map'), then the room
description will include a map of the rooms around the player.

Symbols used for the map are :

#g*#n  Woodland, Forest, Plains
#8@#n  Mountain, Hill
#nO#n  Inside, City
#L=#n  Water, Ocean, Sea
#C#-#n  Air, Flying
#y+#n  Desert

The symbols '#o|#n' and '#o-#n' represents roads, tunnels, etc.

~

1 'MARTIAL SKILL'~
A ninjas fighting abilities relies entirely on their level of
martial skill, which can be increased by using the shadowlearn
command. The cost is 10 primal for each level of martial skill,
meaning that the 11th skill will cost 110 primal, and the 14th
skill will cost 140 primal.

The martials will increase the ninjas ability to dogde and parry,
as well as give additional attack in combat.

~

1 MASTERY~
When you have grandmasterd all your stances, spells and weapons,
you can use the mastery command to gain a mastery item, which
is a piece of classeq that's better than your normal classeq.
Mastery doesn't require that you max your superstances, nor
does it require that you have more than 200 in weapons/skills
if that's possible. Getting 200 is enough.

syntax : mastery

NOTE : If you are so stupid that you gemstone your mastery item
       it's your loss, don't expect anyone to care.

~

1 MCCP MCCLIENT~
Mccp is a compression protocol, and the two main benefits of mccp are:

1. lower bandwidth usage by the mud.
2. clients (i.e. players) get large responses (such as, for example, combat
   spam) from the mud at a higher rate - the mud will "feel" faster, despite
   the fact that the actual round-trip times are unchanged.

With a suitable client, mccp is entirely transparent to the user - it
automatically enables itself when supported by both the server and client.

For more details on the protocol, your welcome to visit the MCCP homepage

#Ghttp://www.randomly.org/projects/MCCP/#n

Currently the following mud clients are know to support mccp.

* Papaya
* Tkturf
* Mcl
* Amcl (cvs only)
* Kmud
* Zmud (version 6 only)
* Mushclient

If you use mccp, you will be rewarded by an extra 25% exp bonus.

-1 MEETING~
#RThe meeting#n

As you stumble down the dark corridor, you come upon the form of a humanoid creature,
it doesn't look very menacing nor threatening, but as you get closer you see how wrong
you really were. Though the create looks slim and scrawny, the face is horrid beyond
reality, grey ashy skin, and huge black voids for eyes, all set into an empty expression
that marks the face in a way more horrid than the tentacles that surrounds the mouth
or the dark fluid that runs from the open sores on it's body. As you stumble to a halt,
a sense of vertigo falls over you, and the world around you change to something not quite
real, but not quite a fantasy; as if the settings was wrought from your innermost
memories, just that this is nothing you have ever experience, more like your worst
nightmare; the nightmare you had once, but have forgotten, pushed into the darkest
parts of your mind.... the nightmare comes alive, and a hulking creature stands infront
of you - the same creature that was once the scrawny humanoid you met in the corridor,
somewhere far far away. Now you know.... know for sure.... the nightmare has just begun.

What these dronelike creatures really are, is something no one really knows. Their unnatural
behaviour, and the fact that no known habitat have ever been found (on any plane) calls for
the conclusion that these creatures don't really exist, but infact are figments of our
imagination, some dark, twisted, perverted version of our darkest fears.

1 MONK MONKS~
These Followers of god, have devoted their lives to protect and help
the good. They will fight against evil anytime to destroy and banish the evil
from this world. With them they have been granted with the power of god.
These powers are called mantras.

~

0 MONKCHI~
A monk's chi is the essential part of combat.  The higher
the monk's chi, the better he or she can parry and dodge
blows.  It also gives the monk more strength and power,
thus letting him or her inflict more damage and receive
less.  Maintaining chi is very strenuous, and requires
that the monk have plenty of vitality.
~

0 MONKCOMBO~
By using his or her special techniques, such as thrust kick,
in a certain order, he or she may perform special combos.
Each combo has a different effect.  Some may do damage to the
victim, some syphon movement points, and some may stun the victim.
A monk's combos are a very mysterious thing, thus the monk
must spend much of his or her life trying to perfect
these combos.

Lightning Kick - Strikes the opponent with a series of powerful kicks.
Tornado Kick   - Strikes everyone in the room with kicks.
Choyoken       - A devastating attack that targets the opponents stamina.
Raptor Strike  - An attack that syphons the mystical energies of the target.
Nerve Pinch    - A series of attacks targeted at central nerves, paralysing.

1 MSP SOUNDS MUSIC~
MSP stands for Mud Sound Protocol, and it's a way of allowing muds
to use sounds and affects to increase the fun of mudding.

You can either download all the sounds first (that's probably
the smartest thing to do), or let your mudclient download them
when they are needed (it will only download them once, and then
reuse the downloaded sound next time it's needed).

Just type 'sound' to toggly sounds on/off.
~

1 MULTIPLAYING PLAYERSHARING~
Multiplaying and playersharing is strictly forbidden, the rules
are as this (and don't try and find loopholes, I'll just wipe you).

* No more than 1 char can connect via 1 ip, so local networks
  don't work, unless you have more than one ip available.
* Going linkdead to trade items from one char to another is not
  allowed, it still counts as multiplaying.
* Having more than one person controlling a character on the mud
  is called playersharing and it not allowed.
* No transfering of items and/or qps from one char to another
  that you own, read HELP RULES on how I deal with people who
  think they found a loophole.
* No using one of your characters to help another in some way
  or another. Be smart, keep your characters seperated.
* If an immortal tells you to stop multiplaying, you will stop
  instantly, there will only be given one warning, next time
  ANYONE multiplays from that ip, ALL chars from that ip will
  be deleted.

Don't argue, if an imm tells you that your multiplaying, then
you are. We don't give a shit if it's your mother that controls
the other character.

1 NCOMBOS~
Once a ninja has mastred the ninja attack styles, he or she can
use them in combination to achive powerful affects. So far 7 such
combos are known to exists, and only by experimenting can a ninja
truly master them all.

One though, is well known among all ninjas, and that's the ability
to form a barrier of cutting knifes infront of yourself. This is
easily done by using the caltrop attack followed by a knifespin.

All affects given by ninja combos requires a few class points each
turn to keep running.

-1 NEWBIE~
#RThe Newbie Helper#n

#R*#n First kill some mobs in the newbie arena (located south of where you start, that's
  up and south from recall), when you have 2K hps, you can train avatar and use
  the selfclass command to gain a class.
#R*#n After getting a class, you should get a little buffer from killing mobs in newbie
  arena, then move on to either Elemental Canyon or The Black Dragons Lair.
  The Lair can be found 1 south, 6 east, 2 south and down from recall.
#R*#n During the first 4 hours of play you cannot be attacked by other players, and should
  use this time to get stronger, remember to get all your class powers, read the
  help file on your class and do the best you can.
#R*#n There are some help files you might want to read, since they'll help you alot.
  The list : BRIEF, EXP, MCCLIENT, CHANGES, RULES and POLICY, they each contain knowledge
  that is useful for new players to this mud (not just newbies).
#R*#n Remember the following :
  #R*#n The higher your unarmed ability is, the less you will get hit by monsters.
  #R*#n Treat others with the same respect you would want them to show you, it will
    help you get along alot easier (Remember be nice while you are small, you can always be mean later)
  #R*#n If you don't know how a thing is done, try seeing if there is a help file on the
    subject, if there isn't we could use one, and your welcome to write it and mail it to the staff.

Good luck, and all that :)

announcements are posted. The commands used to access, read and write
on these boards, are :

* note <read|write|list>
  - read will read the next note on the board (or a given note
    for example 'note read 7').

~

1 OBEAH~
Obeah is the most useful of vampire disciplines, and allows the vampire
to wear equipment and cast spells while in zulo/dragon form, and it
grants access to a powerful healing skill called 'purify'.

~

0 OBFUSCATE~
Kindred with this Discipline excel at hiding among and away from crowds.  
When they do not wish to be seen, others rarely notice them even if they 
are standing in plain view.  Though this Discipline affects others minds 
and does not actually render the users invisible, the end result is much 
the same.  Obfuscate is the opposing Discipline to Auspex, and they 
cancel out many of each others powers.

<<*>> #rMask#n Allows you to disguise yourself as another player.
<<*>> #rShield#n Protects you from the Auspex 'scry' and 'readaura' powers.
<<*>> #rMortal#n Switches between vampire and mortal mode.  While in mortal 
      form, you loose all vampire advantages and disadvantages, and are 
      undetectable from a normal mortal.
<<*>> #rVanish#n allows the player to be invisible to the common eye.
<<*>> #rConceal#n This power hides any object it is used on.

~

1 OBTAIN INPART~
These two commands can be used to gaining new powers as a demon,
obtain costs 15000 class points, and will give the demon a random
warp. The inpart command allows the demon to buy demon powers.

~

0 OBTENEBRATION~
Obtenebration allows the user to manipulate the powers of darkness.  By 
using their powers they are able to switch between the normal world and 
the plane of shadows at will.  They may also view things in both planes 
simultaneously if they so wish.

<<*>> #rShroud#n This power is an advanced hide.
<<*>> #rShadowsight#n This power allows you to see in the Umbra.
<<*>> #rNightSight#n This power allows the kindred to see in the dark.
<<*>> #rShadowstep#n This allows you to step through the umbra without
      being seen and appear in front of your victim.
<<*>> #rLamprey#n This powerful ability allows you to shoot tendrils
      at your victim entraping them.
~

7 OCLONE~
Syntax: oclone <object>

This creates an identical copy of the specified object, with the only 
exceptions being that the cloned objects creator is the person creating 
the clone, and the cloned objects owner is not set.
~

1 OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK PICK~
Syntax: open   <object|direction>
Syntax: close  <object|direction>
Syntax: lock   <object|direction>
Syntax: unlock <object|direction>
Syntax: pick   <object|direction>

OPEN and CLOSE open and close an object or a door.

LOCK and UNLOCK lock and unlock a closed object or door.  You must have
the requisite key to LOCK or UNLOCK.

PICK can open a lock without having the key.  In order to PICK successfully,
you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

1 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

7 OTRANSFER~
Syntax: otransfer <object>
Syntax: otransfer <object> <character>

This will transfer the specified object to the specified character.  The 
character is defaulted to yourself.

~

1 PARADOX~
When a player decaps someone not in their range, they get paradox'ed,
which means they end up morted in midgaard, which really isn't healthy.
A player getting paradox'ed will also lose 10% of their MAX hps.

The range works in this way :

Each player has a certain powerscore assigned to them, and this score will
go up (or down) as this player gets more powerful, these are the things that
affect how powerful you are in regard to the powerscore :

* How many hitpoints you have (max hps, not current).
* If you have mastery or not.
* How many superstances you have (0 to 5).
* Whether your an upgrade or not.
* A small change for the amount of rune a player may have.
* Spell affects like trains or blesses should will not affect this score.

If you decap someone which are not within your range, you get a paradoxcounter,
should you ever get 3 of these counters you will be struck by paradox. You can
only get rid of counters by decapping players within your range.

Also read PARADOXSTATS.

~

1 PARADOXSTATS~
Taking a base in hps, the paradoxrange looks at a number calculated from the following.

* Each skill mastered (weapons, stances, spells) gives a small modifier,
  a fully mastered player get's a 10K total modifier.
* Superstances counts as 5K hps a piece. (25K hps when you have ss5).

If a player doesn't have more than 15K now, we don't add anything else.
  #G(#yactually a player with less than 15K can't be killed nor kill#G)#n
But if the player has more than 15K we take a look at the following.

* Possible Rune eq counts as 1K hps a piece for a max of 14 (yes, 14K).
* Being an upgrade will modify this number in a special way :)
* Each extra level beyond level 1 as upgrade counts as an extra 12K hps.

We then compare the number of the attacker and the defender, deciding
whether the attacker is allowed to decap or not.

And no, I will not explain this any better, if you don't understand, then
you'll just have to live with not understanding.

~

0 'PASS DOOR'~
Syntax: cast 'pass door'

This spell enables the caster to pass through closed doors.
~

1 PASSWORD~
Syntax: password <old-password> <new-password>

PASSWORD changes your character's password.  The first argument must be

1 PKPOWERS~
Pkpowers are special powers that becomes available to players as
they rise in pkscore. To see your pkscore type 'top' this will
not only show you your own score, but also show the top10 of
best players (in regard to pkscore).

The pkscore is based on your pk record (kills and deaths), and
you gain a power for each 500 points you have. You can type
'pkpower' to gain a list of powers you can use.

pkscore   power
-----------------
  500    Sanctum         -  a healing power.
 1000    Eaglesight      -  a scrying power.
 1500    Awareness       -  (auto).
 2000    Lifesense       -  a readaura power.
 2500    Supreme attack  -  (auto).
 3000    Call to Arms    -  summons help.
 3500    Objectscry      -  scry through items.
 4000    Ironmind	 -  reverse damage.
 4500    Crystalsight    -  superior sight for a while.
 5000    Darkhunter      -  summons the hunter (HELP HUNTER).

~

1 PKRULES~
To discourage ganging and feeding, a system has been implanted
that will monitor any pk aggressions made by players. Whenever
someone attacks a player far below their normal pk-range, their
special pk counter will increase a few ticks, UNLESS

* The player they attacked had already aggressed against them.

This pk counter will slowly decrease over time, so unless the
player has a tendency to harras small players over and over, he
or she will never get into trouble. When the counter reaches
a certain level, it will drop back to 0, and give a bully flag
to the player, which will last 2 full hours.

To protect larger players from provocative attacks, a player
will get a special flag if he or she attacks a player who are
much larger than themselfs - we can call this flag for the
you-asked-for-it-so-you-deserve-it flag. When a player has
this flag (and it will go away after a short while), the
provoked player can attack the small player without fearing
a pk counter increase.

To protect smaller players from beeing fed (the larger player
already gets a small increase in his or her pk counter for
doing attack, but let's add more), we add a certain amount
of protection to the attacked player - he or she cannot be
attacked by anyone else for a short period of time, thus
preventing most feeding situations.

Remember - The best way to discourage bad pk behaviour is
by starting with yourself. If you act honorable towards
others, they will act the same way towards you.

~

1 POINTS 'CLASS POINTS'~
Certain classes gain clas points when killing monsters. These points
are usualy used to buy new powers, but some powers might require that
the player spend a certain amount of class points each time the power 
is used.

spells and abilitites.
~

1 PROMPT CPROMPT~
This command allows you to configure your prompt.  The PROMPT command 
will set your standard prompt.  You also have the option of having a 
combat prompt, CPROMPT, which will appear while fighting.  If no cprompt 
is defined, the standard prompt will be used for both conditions.

To switch your prompt on and off, use 'prompt on' and 'prompt off'.
For some examples, type 'help prompts'.
~

1 PROMPTS~

favoured setups.  However, to get you going, here are some examples:

Original normal prompt: [%x exp] <%h/%Hhp %m/%Mm %v/%Vmv>
Original combat prompt: [%f] <%h/%Hhp %m/%Mm %v/%Vmv>
Simple prompt: [%hH/%mM/%vV]

prompts with 'prompt on' and 'prompt off'.  Doing this will not destroy 
your customised prompts.

0 PROTEAN~
This Discipline allows a vampire to transform either their entire body or 
a part of their body into something inhuman.  The vampire can thus grow 
claws, turn into a bat, transform into a wolf or dissolve into a fine 
mist.  A vampire can use most other Disciplines while shapeshifted, but 
may not cast spells.  Full transformation is not possible during combat, 
although claws can be grown if you are fighting.  While shapeshifted the 
vampire cannot wear any equipment.

<<*>> #rUmbravision#n A combination of truesight shadowsight allows
      you to see any hidden charchter accept for monk and ninja.
<<*>> #rFlamehands#n This power erupts your hands into flames.
<<*>> #rEarthmeld#n Allows you to sink into the ground hiding from enemies.
<<*>> #rClaws#n Enables the user to grow inch-long claws on each finger.  These 
      claws have no effect if the vampire is armed, however if not they cause 
      considerably more damage than a normal unarmed attack.
<<*>> #rChange#n Allow the vampire to transform into bat, wolf or mist.  Bat 
      form can fly and detect almost everything (invis, hidden, etc).  While in 
      wolf form, the vampire enjoys the benefit of an extra 500hp and greatly 
      enhanced combat abilities.  Mist form is impervious to attacks and can 
      pass through doors.  Beware though, for two vampires in mist form CAN 
      attack each other.
~

0 PROTECTION SANCTUARY~
Syntax: cast protection
Syntax: cast sanctuary  <character>

1 QUEST QUESTMASTERS~
A new quest system is in town, and the old one is out. Here is
a short list of commands used (for more details you should read
the quest help on my homepage).

qgain <questmaster>       - gain a new quest from a questmaster.
qcomplete <questmaster>   - get the prize for completing the quest.
showquest                 - lists all quests you are doing.

During Questors Delight, gained qps will be doubled, and faithpoints
adds an extra qps for each 10 points of max faith you have.

example (goto pappa smurf)

> qgain smurf
> showquest
(complete the quest and return to pappa smurf)
> qcomplete smurf

The real questmasters can be found down from the old questroom,
that is east of the executioner.

~

1 QUESTKEY~
#yQuest#RKey#n is a unique prize, as i would recommend you to store -
if you find any! 
I usually make an info when I put one out, but not every time.
You can locate a questkey with the locate spell, simple as that!
It cannot be claimed or stored in a container.
Players can cap you and loot it.
Some keys can be worn, and will have some affects.
But most important, you can trade it for goods .. :)

1  Questkey      1000qp or 20000000 exp
3  Questkey      +10 hit/dam or -50 ac on a item
5  Questkey      +5 to avarage damage on a weapon

~

1 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and objects.  You must be a mortal or avatar to
save.  The game will auto-save your character every few minutes whether you
save or not.

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere, although there is an experience
penalty for quitting outside of Midgaard.  When you re-enter the game you will
be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

-1 RAGNAROK~
#0RAGNAROK MODE#n

When time comes, the world will sunder and the gods will walk the earth
spreading havoc and destruction, this is a time of slaughter, and no one
will be safe, this is the age of Ragnarok.

Using the command 'mudstat' you'll be able to tell if ragnarok is on,
if it's not, you'll just get the normal mudstat screen.

Doing ragnarok the following changes are in effect :

* There are no safe rooms.
* Everyone has scry, and it bypasses all shields.
* You can decap anyone, anywhere. (no paradox).
* Heads will vanish faster.
* Players will auto train avatar and get a restore.
* Upgrades can only fight other upgrades.
* You do not lose ANYTHING if capped during ragnarok.
* Base classes can only fight other base classes.
* You are safe for 3 ticks after training avatar. (to rewear)

player can turn on ragarok buy pooling qps toward it, using
the ragnarok command. ie. 'ragnarok 200' will add 200 qps
to the ragnarok pool (currently 3000 qps is needed to turn
on ragnarok). mudstat will show how many qps is still needed,
and ragnarok cannot be turned on for two hours after it has
last been on.

Ragnarok lasts 15 minutes.

Enjoy

8 REBOOT SHUTDOWN WIZLOCK~
Syntax: reboot
Syntax: shutdown
Syntax: wizlock

REBOOT shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

below level 36 may not log in.  Players who lose their links, however,

~

1 RELBUY RELPOWERS~
It is possible to buy certain religion powers for the faithpoints you gain
from killing other players (and in particular those from opposing religions).

Though all priests have access to the same powers, the cost of the powers differs
from religion to religion. A member of the church of The One True would have to
pay more for the power to induce madness, whereas one of the Gahr worshippers would
have to pay more for the power of Divine Fury. As a player grows in rank inside
his or her church, the more expensive powers will start to cost less faith points
to gain. When a player types 'relbuy' they get a list of powers they can buy,
those that are colored WHITE are the powers in the players sphere, whereas those colored
GREY are located in the spheres of other gods. All power can be bought, but the cost
will depend on the players rank and religion.

A players faith points are divided into two. One number is the total amount of faith
that player has achived (which decides rank), and the other is the amount of faith
that player has left to buy powers for.

The cost for a given power is 20 fps per rank, this cost is doubled if it's a power
from a sphere the priest doesn't normally have access to. Should a priest try to
achive a power which is beyond his or her level (religion rank), then the price
is again doubled. (The prices listed on the relbuy list is the actual price you
need to pay).

syntax : relbuy <power>

Also take a look at HELP RPR1, RPR2, RPR3, etc.

~

-1 RELIGION FAITH BELIEF DEITY~
The known religions of Dystopia :

Five deities or pantheons are known to be worshipped throughout the realms
known as Dystopia; the followers of these godly beings are among the finest
of warriors, the very best Dystopia has to offer. To join one of the five
churches or cults, you must first master yourself, then you may pledge
alligiance to one of the churches in 'The Halls of Enlightenment'.

As a follower of one of the churches, you must pay a tithe of 5% of the
exp you earn; but for this tithe you gain acces to some of the special
powers, that only the true believers can master. Ofcourse no simple neonate
gains acces to the most powerful commands of the gods; first they must
climb the hierachy within their own church walls, and find the divine favor
of their deity.

When you kill other players, you gain faithpoints, these points represents
how much status you have within the chuch. For each 100 faithpoints you gain,
you also gain a rank in your religion. If you go below the required faithlevel
you will lose the rank again.

The amount you gain is modified by this :

Killing playes with a higher rank than you will give more faith.
killing players that are bigger than you will give more faith.
Killing playes that oppose your religion will give more faith.

You don't want to get killed because :

Getting killed by opposing religions will lower your faith.
Getting killed in general will lower your faith a little.

Read more about RELIGIONPOWERS and DEITIES.
~

1 RELIGIONPOWERS HOLYSYMBOL~
As you grow closer to your god, you gain acces to more gifts granted by your deity,
these are known to be, but not limited to :

Personal login/logout messages.
Personal decapitate messages.

There will also be powers that depend on what deity you worship, but that's all
to come later, lot's of work to be done.

Current religion commands :

* reltalk      - Faith talk channel
* worship      - Worship a god (ONCE)
* settie       - Sets your tie message    (HELP SETTIE)
* setdecap     - Sets your decap message  (HELP SETDECAP)

1 STANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

In combat, the stance of the fighter plays a very important role; you 
can't just stand there and exchange blow for blow unless you are very 
confident of your ability.  Each fighting stance has advantages and 
disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:
VIPER: A very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating on 
striking your opponent before they have the chance to avoid or block you.
CRANE: A wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a very 
strong blocking defence.
CRAB: A low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork and 
rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
MONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics to 
ensure that by the time your opponent makes their attack, you've moved 
out of the way.
BULL: A low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on physical power.

#RThe reqs for upgrading is #0:#n
50K hp, 35K mana, 35K move, 40K Questpoints and generation 1.

For each 100 pkscore you have less than 1000, you must pay an extra
3K in hp/move/mana to upgrade, you cannot pay more than 30K extra.

Having more than 1000 pkscore will not reduce the cost for upgrading.

When you upgrade you get set to 5K across and loose ALL class powers,
then you get your new class. You've been warned, so don't whine when
you lose all your old powers, that's just life.

It is possible for an upgrade to improve their powers even
more, read HELP UPGRADE2 to check out the facts.

~

1 UPGRADE2~
When a player have upgrade to his new class, he/she can upgrade
again and again, though instead of losing his or her old class and
gaining a new one, they keep their class and powers, but gets set
to 5K across. In return for this, they gain additional damcap/dodge/
parry/attacks/etc.

#GThe reqs for the next upgrade #0:#n

 #Rlevel  #0| #RHP/MOVE/MANA #0| #Rqps  #0| #Rpkscore#n
#0 --------------------------------------#n
   #G2    #0|  #G80K across  #0|  #G40K #0|  #G2000#n
   #G3    #0|  #G90K across  #0|  #G80K #0|  #G2500#n
   #G4    #0| #G100K across  #0| #G120K #0|  #G3000#n
   #G5    #0| #G110K across  #0| #G160K #0|  #G3500#n

If you are missing pkscore, you can "pay" 1500 in stats
for each 100 missing pkscore. (e.g. if your missing 400
in pkscore, then you need 6000 extra move/mana/hps to
upgrade again). You can never pay more than 120K in stats
to upgrade, no matter how low your pkscore is.

#CThe maximum level is 5#n

-1 VAMPIRE VAMPIRES~
#0Vampires#n are the creatures of the night and thus take damage if exposed
to daylight.  Vampires cannot eat food, or drink any liquids except for
blood.  If they cannot drink blood for a long duration of time they will
start taking damage or maybe even go berserk, so it's a good idea to store
some blood in a drinking container.  Vampires take half damage from cold,
none from gas, and double from fire, although those with the Heat
immunity take normal fire damage rather than double.

#0Embrace#n     - embrace a mob to drain their blood, use embrace again to
              release. (embrace depends on red spell level)
#0Vamparmor#n   - create vampire eq. (make a ring for rage/regen)

#0Inconnu#n     - an inconnu vampire has to be diabed instead of decapped by
              other vampires.
#0Regenerate#n  - when unraged use this to regen.
#0Disciplines#n - use research to begin a discipline when done train the
              discipline. (theres 10 levels of each discipline)
#0Age#n         - use train to increase your age the older the vamp the better.

0 VOODOO~
Syntax: Spell:   cast voodoo <victim>
        Ability: voodoo <victim> <action>

Voodoo magic allows the caster to do things to another player indirectly.
First, a body part of the victim is needed.  The caster should hold this 
part and cast the spell on the target (they don't have to be in the same 
room).  This will create the voodoo doll, which the caster the voodoo 
commands on to interfere with the victim.
There are three voodoo actions.  The first, 'Stab', is only of use as a 
warning to the victim, or to cause annoyance.  The second, 'Throw', will 
hurl the victim from their feet and cause a small amount of damage.  The 
third and final action, 'Burn', will set the victim on fire, as well as 
destroy the doll itself.
~

1 VOTE POLL~
Dystopia has a voting system. Just remember, this is not a democracy,
and any final rulings will be made by me.

To vote, you need to be at least 10 hours old, and have killed 1000
mobs; also you can only vote once (ie. no alts) - if you try to use an
alt, any votes you have cast will simply be removed.

Type 'vote' to get a list of current polls. To vote on any of the polls
simply follow this example : Theres a poll called 'mages', and you want
to cast your vote on the 2nd option, so you type 'vote mages 2'.

Can it be any simpler ?

~

1 VT100~
If your client supports the vt100 protocol, you can make your
prompt stay at the bottom of your screen permanent. This is
done by typing 'vt100' while standing in a safe room. The mud
will then talk to your mudclient, asking it for your screen
size. If your client responds, the mud will figure out where
on your screen it should "trap" your prompt.

To disable vt100, simply type vt100 again (this can be done
anywhere, so you don't need a safe room for this).

~

1 WARLORD~
The Warlord is a powerful mob, which is able to actually behead players.
Taking out The Warlord is not easy, and it usually requires teamwork.

The Warlord gives 5 million experience points to every single member
of the group that kills him, and he is usually carrying some powerful
and useful items.

Beware The Warlord.

~

1 WARPS~
All warps are automatic, so you don't need any commands to activate them, just the command
obtain to get new warps. Theres a total of 18 warps, some have an affect, others don't.

These are the possible warps :

Your body is protected by a indestructable crystal shell.
Your skin is as hard as steel.
Your arms are incredibly strong.
Your legs are incredibly strong.
Your tongue is long and venomous.
Your tail fires deadly spikes during combat.
Your breath is putrid and deadly.
You have incredible speed.
You have increased stamina, reducing the damage you take.
Your heightened senses enable you to hunt people. (*)
You have the ability to devour your opponents, sending them into the pits of Hell. (*)
Your features are so horrid that they may stun those who look at you. (*)
Your body has the ability to regenerate incredibly fast.
Your mounts transform into hideous Demons. (use the mount spell)
You have the power to transform into a deadly battle axe. (*)
Your body is composed of deadly magma.
Your skin is covered with shards of ice.
A pair of leathery wings protrude from your back.

The warps with (*) doesn't have any affect, and some of the warps are
used together with inparts or disciplines, most are just extra attacks
in combat or extra toughnes.

Maybe some day when I have some spare time, I'll clean up the demon powers,
but currently you'll just have to live with the mess.

1 WHO~
Typing who will show a list of the players online that you can see, using the following style :

#p  Title#n      #y(#Gx.xx#y)#n     #0<<#RCLASS#0>>#n         PlayerName      #C-= #PFAITH #C=-#n

* The Title is based on the players size, and who is sorted somewhat after this.
  The lowest title is 'Wannabe' and they cannot kill nor be killed by other players.
  If your a wannabe and want to pk, then you need to grow in size first, this is
  done by either training more hitpoints or training more skills (weapons, stances, etc).

* The (x.xx) is the pkratio of that player, and the colors around the numbers shows
  whether you can kill that player and if she/he can kill you, heres the deal :

  if the #R()#n's are red, that means you can #Gboth#n kill eachother.
  if the #0()#n's are black, that means that the player can #Gkill you#n, but you can't kill him/her.
  if the #y()#n's are yellow, that means you can #Gkill them#n, but they can't kill you.
  if the #L()#n's are blue, #Gneither#n of you can kill eachother.

* The Class and PlayerName are obvious.

* The religion tag will show what god/deity that player worships, and will also show
  the rank of that player within the given Church/Coven.

Enjoy!

-1 WILD~
#GThe Pantheon of the Wild#n

The Pantheon is formed by the three gods of nature, each controlling a their of the
world. Wind, earth and water divided amongst them, they fight the onslaught of
civilization, and the scourge of mankind. Few are the followers of the Pantheon,
but those few are the most devoted of worshippers, fighting their own kind to
let nature rule the realms of Dystopia once more. There are no real churches to
the Pantheon, rather small shrines are erected whereever the followers travel.
The Pantheon doesn't allow their worshippers to settle, rather they are encouraged
to travel the wilds, preaching the words of nature, and fighting those that abuse
or hurt the nature in any way. The core of worshipping The Pantheon is allowing
yourself to be truly free, relinquishing property and material desires, living
from day to day, in perfect harmony with nature.

The Worshippers oppose The Stars and The Crawling Chaos in the circle of balance.

Read help on WILDRANK.

-1 WILDRANK~
#GThe ranks in The Pantheon of the Wild#n

#GThe Weeds of The Wild#n are the most common of the worshippers; they call themselfs
the weeds to indicate that even weed have more right to exist than man. Living with
nature, and protecting it mankind is the first principle of the weeds.

#GThe Hunters of The Wild#n live in harmony with nature, and has become a part of the
big circle of life, feasting of the riches of nature, and finally dying so that nature
can feast on them, completing the circle. These people are much feared, for they themselds
fear nothing. Rebirth is the main structure in the belief system, and those that fear
not dying, have no reason to fear anything.

#GThe Protectors of The Wild#n have risen from the ranks of the worshippers of the Wild,
and taken upon themselfs to protect the nature from those that does not understand.
Death to mankind and their beloved cities are one of many cries that can be heard
while The Protectors savegely demolishes a manmade city.

#GThe Harmonists of The Wild#n are those that have begun their sojourn. A journey unlike
many others, for this journey starts from within and ends within. As The Harmonist
explore his or her own essence and belief, and find his or her place in the world,
they evolve beyond that of normal man, becoming truly one with their beloved nature.

#GThe Forces of The Wild#n are those that have survived the passage within, and have come
to terms with who and what they are. The Forces are no longer considered to be a
part of mankind, but are rather revered as elemental forms, creatures who have risen
from the slavery of the flesh, and has chosen to fight beside nature as a part of it,
instead of protecting it from the outside.
